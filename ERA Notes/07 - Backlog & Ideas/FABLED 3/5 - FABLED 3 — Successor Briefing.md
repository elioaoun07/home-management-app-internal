# Backlog & Ideas · FABLED 3.5 — Successor Briefing

[_index](<_index.md>) · [3.1 Current](<1 - FABLED 3 — Current Implementation.md>) · [3.2 Gaps](<2 - FABLED 3 — Gaps & Missing.md>) · [3.3 Optimization](<3 - FABLED 3 — Optimization Plan.md>) · [3.4 Enhancements](<4 - FABLED 3 — Future Enhancements.md>) · [3.5 Successor Briefing](<5 - FABLED 3 — Successor Briefing.md>)

## Who should read this

You are an AI model about to edit documents in `ERA Notes/07 - Backlog & Ideas/`. Docs work is the safest work in the repo — but these files are load-bearing (agents boot from them), so wrong docs are worse than no docs.

## First 5 minutes

```bash
git log --format="%h %ad %s" --date=short --since=2026-07-18 -- "ERA Notes/07 - Backlog & Ideas"
```

Then skim the section's `FABLED 2/_index.md` scoreboard (frozen) and this pack's `_index` ledger.

## Rules of the section

- **Augment, never duplicate** (Documentation Rules): update the existing doc; a parallel doc is a future zombie.
- Adding ideas is any-model; PROMOTING an idea into a campaign checklist is the step that matters and the one nobody does.
- Any claim you write about code must carry a verify command or a source path — the FABLED house style applies to all vault docs now.

## Trap registry

| Trap | Symptom | Guard |
|---|---|---|
| Ideas rot here | treating presence-in-backlog as 'planned' | only campaign checklists are the queue of record (`pnpm pm`) |

## Verification manifest

| Claim | Command | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| Churn claim | `git log --oneline c561635..f0a8e19 -- "ERA Notes/07 - Backlog & Ideas" | wc -l` | 2 |

## What FABLED 2 got wrong here

Nothing.
