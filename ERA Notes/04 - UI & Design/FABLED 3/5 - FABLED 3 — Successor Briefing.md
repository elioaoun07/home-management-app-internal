# UI & Design · FABLED 3.5 — Successor Briefing

[_index](<_index.md>) · [3.1 Current](<1 - FABLED 3 — Current Implementation.md>) · [3.2 Gaps](<2 - FABLED 3 — Gaps & Missing.md>) · [3.3 Optimization](<3 - FABLED 3 — Optimization Plan.md>) · [3.4 Enhancements](<4 - FABLED 3 — Future Enhancements.md>) · [3.5 Successor Briefing](<5 - FABLED 3 — Successor Briefing.md>)

## Who should read this

You are an AI model about to edit documents in `ERA Notes/04 - UI & Design/`. Docs work is the safest work in the repo — but these files are load-bearing (agents boot from them), so wrong docs are worse than no docs.

## First 5 minutes

```bash
git log --format="%h %ad %s" --date=short --since=2026-07-18 -- "ERA Notes/04 - UI & Design"
```

Then skim the section's `FABLED 2/_index.md` scoreboard (frozen) and this pack's `_index` ledger.

## Rules of the section

- **Augment, never duplicate** (Documentation Rules): update the existing doc; a parallel doc is a future zombie.
- Atlas upkeep is any-model and mandatory (Hard Rule 23); design-system rule changes are owner territory.
- Any claim you write about code must carry a verify command or a source path — the FABLED house style applies to all vault docs now.

## Trap registry

| Trap | Symptom | Guard |
|---|---|---|
| Atlas sync is a hard rule | new page ships without an Atlas entry | Hard Rule 23; `update-atlas.sh` hook regenerates atlas.json but the MD entry is manual |
| Color identity is person-absolute | swapping colors by viewer role | Hard Rule 14; `Color Identity.md` is the spec |

## Verification manifest

| Claim | Command | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| Atlas pm entry exists | `ls "ERA Notes/04 - UI & Design/Page & Feature Atlas/pm.md"` | exists |

## What FABLED 2 got wrong here

Nothing material in window.
