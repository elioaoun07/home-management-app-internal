# Budget · 2 — Vision & Roadmap

> **Command Center:** [\_index](_index.md) · [1 · Feature State](<1 - Feature State.md>) · [2 · Vision & Roadmap](<2 - Vision & Roadmap.md>) · [3 · Action Plan](<3 - Action Plan.md>) · [4 · Checklist](<4 - Checklist.md>)
>
> **What this file is:** the _ambitious_ Budget file — where the money domain could go. Enhancements to what exists **and** richer connections to the rest of the app. This is allowed to dream; [1 · Feature State](<1 - Feature State.md>) is the sober reality. Ladders up to the global [3 · Future Vision](<../3 - Future Vision & Roadmap.md>).

## The strategic thesis

Budget is the household's **money graph** — every account, transaction, recurring obligation, debt, and planned purchase lives here. Today it is a strong _reactive_ ledger: you record money in and out, it shows balances and analytics. Its untapped value is twofold:

1. **It is the second spine ERA should read from** (the first being Schedule's time graph). A cashflow-aware assistant can warn before a recurring payment overdraws an account — but only if the money graph is forecast-able, not just historical.
2. **Money and time are the same fact, recorded twice.** A recurring payment's due-date is a Schedule reminder; a debt's collection date is a reminder; a future purchase's target date is a deadline. The biggest wins unify these so confirming one closes the other.

**The vision in one line:** _Turn Budget from a ledger you review into a money graph that forecasts — telling you what's affordable, what's due, and what's drifting, before you ask._

## Track B — Bridges out of Budget (cross-module)

Each ladders up to a track in the global [3 · Future Vision](<../3 - Future Vision & Roadmap.md>).

- **Recurring → Schedule (due-dated payments).** A recurring payment's due-date and a Schedule reminder are the same intent — unify so confirming a payment closes the reminder. _(global Track A · Recurring→Budget; Track C · Cashflow)_
- **Debt → Schedule.** Auto-create a reminder on a debt's collection date. _(global Track A · Debt→Reminder 2e)_
- **Future Purchase → Transaction.** Linking the actual purchase auto-completes the wishlist item. _(gap 2f)_
- **Budget → ERA briefing.** Feed cashflow + overspend signals into the proactive briefing so ERA can warn before a problem. _(global Track B · briefing enrichment)_ — _first piece IMPLEMENTED 2026-06-27:_ Budget AI now produces an on-demand **structured spending analysis** (`AnalysisReport`: KPIs, insights, anomalies, recommendations) that renders as a chat answer **and** a dashboard. Follow-up fixes _(IMPLEMENTED 2026-06-27)_: duplicate model category labels are merged before dashboard rendering, and `analysis_report` is persisted on `ai_messages` so historical answers can reopen **View as Dashboard** without another AI call. The structured signals now exist; wiring them into the _proactive_ ERA briefing is the remaining step. See [Spending Analysis Report](<../../03 - Junction Modules/AI Assistant/Spending Analysis Report.md>).
- **Statement Import → Inventory/Catalogue.** Parsed grocery lines could pre-fill inventory or catalogue prices (longer reach).

## 🎯 The bets (my recommendation)

If you point the next stretch at Budget:

1. **Bet 1 — Lock the foundation: test `balance-utils` + recurring next-due.** Lowest effort, kills the highest-stakes gap (wrong money is the worst bug). Do this before any enhancement that touches balances.
2. **Bet 2 — Unify Recurring ↔ Schedule due-dates.** The highest-leverage bridge: money and time stop being recorded twice. Coordinate with [Schedule · 2 · Vision & Roadmap](<../Schedule/2 - Vision & Roadmap.md>) (same bridge from the other side).
3. **Bet 3 — Cashflow forecast → ERA.** The biggest _felt_ upgrade: ERA can warn before an overdraft. Higher effort; scope it after the core tests exist.

> Resist building the cashflow forecast before the core tests exist — a silent balance bug would hide exactly there, and a forecast amplifies it.
